# Major Project Proposal

## Description
My major project is going to be a Capture the Flag (CTF) Hacking Competition. Hopefully taking place 1-3weeks before finals.
It consists of the repositories <b>[REDACTED]</b>, <b>[REDACTED]</b>, and <b>[REDACTED]</b>.
The CTF would take 1.5 - 3 hours, with many challenges and possibly a <b>[REDACTED]</b>.
Teams should consist of 2-4 (5 and 1 may be allowed but not encouraged), even unexperienced people should be able to complete
some of the challenges and only the best should be able to do the most complicated. 

## Need To Have List
 - <b>[REDACTED]</b> Catagories of challenges: <b>[REDACTED]</b>.
 - At least <b>[REDACTED]</b> challenges per catagory.
 - <b>[REDACTED]</b>.
 - A website to access the various challenges.
 - Login and Register portions of the site.
 - Scoreboard on the side of the website.
 - Being able to view how many and which challenges other teams have completed.
 - Unhackable (hopefully) Admin page for use by me during the CTF.
 
### Nessesary Challenges:
 <b>[REDACTED]</b>
 
## Nice To Have List
 - Instead of a <b>[REDACTED]</b>.
   - <b>[REDACTED]</b>
 - <b>[REDACTED]</b> challenges per catagory (The ones added would probably be on the easy side).
 - Sexy looking website for the CTF.
